# Lightning Chats

### Goal

A lightning chat is like a short, focused talk, where the presenter overviews some technical concept or paper in the field of probabilistic modeling and/or machine learning.

# Lightning Chats

### Goal

A lightning chat is a short (15 minute), focused talk, where the presenter overviews some technical concept or paper in the field of probabilistic modeling and/or machine learning.

### Schedule 

For Spring 2026, we meet for lightning chats Fridays. Typically we meet 1:15-1:45pm. On the 2nd Friday of every month, the typical time conflicts with the Smart Fires AI/ML meeting, so on those days we meet 2-2:30pm.   

We will meet in the GSOC Conference Room (Barnard 347).

### Topic Ideas

These are just ideas that have come up ... feel free to choose anything else you'd like.

##### Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling

+ This 2025 Yixin Wang paper uses exponential family attention to model spatiotemporal time series. [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16790)
+ Spatiotemporal Besov Priors for Bayesian Inverse Problems. [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16378)
+ What are some problems with the Vecchia approximation?
+ Predictive stacking. [Reference.](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-13/issue-3/Using-Stacking-to-Average-Bayesian-Predictive-Distributions-with-Discussion/10.1214/17-BA1091.pdf)
+ Generalized conjugate multivariate models: A tool for conjugate modeling of hierarchical spatial models. [Reference.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10618600.2024.2365728) 

##### Diffusion modeling
+  Normalizing flows are limited by their restriction of transformations to be bijections.  [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06707)

##### Statistical modeling
+ Under what conditions are state space models stationary vs. non-stationary?
+ In what sense are the natural parameters of an exponential family ``natural"?  (The paper _Information Geometry of Variational Bayes_  might be interesting for this purpose, as well as for many others.) [Reference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15641)

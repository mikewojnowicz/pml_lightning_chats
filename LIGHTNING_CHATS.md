# Lightning Chats

### Goal

A lightning chat is like a short, focused talk, where the presenter overviews some technical concept or paper in the field of probabilistic modeling and/or machine learning.

### Schedule 

For Fall 2025, we meet for lightning chats Mondays 3:15-3:30pm. We will meet in Mike's Office (Barnard 352) for September and October.  Starting November 3, we will meet in Barnard 347. 

+ Sept 12: Mike - Variational inference suffers under high noise
+ Sept 22: Kunal - Overview of Robust Gaussian Stochastic Process Emulation and Robust Calibration techniques ([Paper 1](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-46/issue-6A/Robust-Gaussian-stochastic-process-emulation/10.1214/17-AOS1648.pdf), [Paper 2](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2023-085/))
+ Sept 29: Jack - Intro to symbolic dynamics
+ Oct 6: Mike - Problems with block approximations to time series inference
+ Oct 13: Kunal - Intro to spatial statistics concepts (Why variograms are introduced in the literature, how to fit a empirical variogram from data)
+ Oct 20: Jack - Spatio Temporal Covariances: Matern (inc. Bessel functions) and extensions
+ Oct 27: Mike
+ Nov 3: Kunal
+ Nov 10: Jack
+ Nov 17: Mike
+ Nov 24: NO MEETING (Thanksgiving)
+ Dec 1: Kunal
+ Dec 8: Jack

### Topic Ideas

These are just ideas that have come up ... feel free to choose anything else you'd like.

##### Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling

+ What are some problems with the Vecchia approximation?
+ What are some different choices of spatiotemporal kernels for GP and what are their motivations and properties?
+ Predictive stacking. [Reference.](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-13/issue-3/Using-Stacking-to-Average-Bayesian-Predictive-Distributions-with-Discussion/10.1214/17-BA1091.pdf)
+ Generalized conjugate multivariate models: A tool for conjugate modeling of hierarchical spatial models. [Reference.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10618600.2024.2365728) 

##### Diffusion modeling
+  Normalizing flows are limited by their restriction of transformations to be bijections.  [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06707)

##### Statistical modeling
+ Under what conditions are state space models stationary vs. non-stationary?
+ In what sense are the natural parameters of an exponential family ``natural"?

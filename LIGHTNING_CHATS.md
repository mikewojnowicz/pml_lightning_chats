# Lightning Chats

### Goal

A lightning chat is like a short, focused talk, where the presenter overviews some technical concept or paper in the field of probabilistic modeling and/or machine learning.

### Topic Ideas

These are just ideas that have come up ... feel free to choose anything else you'd like.

##### Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling

+ What are some problems with the Vecchia approximation?
+ What are some different choices of spatiotemporal kernels for GP and what are their motivations and properties?
+ Predictive stacking. [Reference.](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-13/issue-3/Using-Stacking-to-Average-Bayesian-Predictive-Distributions-with-Discussion/10.1214/17-BA1091.pdf)
+ Generalized conjugate multivariate models: A tool for conjugate modeling of hierarchical spatial models. [Reference.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10618600.2024.2365728) 

##### Diffusion modeling
+  Normalizing flows are limited by their restriction of transformations to be bijections.  [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06707)

##### Statistical modeling
+ Under what conditions are state space models stationary vs. non-stationary?
+ In what sense are the natural parameters of an exponential family ``natural"?
